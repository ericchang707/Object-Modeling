# Object-Modeling
Decide on an object that you want to include in your final animation. You should select the main character, or “protagonist” object from your planned animation to use in this week’s assignment. Keep in mind that a main character does not need to be a human or animal character, but can be almost anything that you can build a story around (e.g. musical instrument, telephone, house, car, or vacuum cleaner).  In part B of this project, you will concentrate on making things move in your final short animation.

Do not use a snowman, panda, penguin or the green android character (the mascot for the mobile OS) as your main character -- if you do, this will be an automatic 20 point deduction.  We saw too many of these as characters in previous projects!

The key aspect of this assignment is that the 3D object that you create should be made up of multiple pieces. You will use the matrix stack and the transformations (rotate, scale, translate) to put together the parts to form the final object.

Here are the required elements for your main character:

Your object should be something recognizable, and not some abstract or random shape.

Use at least twelve different sub-parts to make your object (e.g. six spheres and six cylinders).

Include at least two different kinds of parts in your object (e.g. sphere and block).

Most or all of the sub-parts of your object should be touching or overlapping each other.

Use at least two different colors in your object.

You must use pushes and pops, and they should be balanced (same number of each).

Make use of all three basic transformations to assemble your object (rotate, scale, translate).

Slowly rotate your object to show it from different sides.

Do not make snowman, penguin, panda or the green android (the mobile platform mascot).
Include a screen shot of your object that is square and has a white background (see below).

When your Processing code is run, it should display your object, and slowly rotate it to show what the object looks like from different sides. This rotation of the whole object does not count towards your use of rotate to assemble the object.
